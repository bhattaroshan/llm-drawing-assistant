A tree consists of these steps to draw:

1. Draw the trunk as a rectangle:
   - Position: x=300, y=400
   - Size: width=40, height=100
   - Fill color: brown shades like "#8B4513" (saddle brown) or "#A0522D" (sienna)
   - Outline: black or dark brown

2. Draw the main foliage as an ellipse (oval):
   - Center position: x=320, y=350
   - Horizontal radius (rx): 60
   - Vertical radius (ry): 70
   - Fill color: green shades like "#228B22" (forest green), "#32CD32" (lime green), or "#006400" (dark green)
   - Outline: transparent or dark green
   - Outline width: 0 or 1

3. Draw smaller foliage clusters as circles:
   - Positions (approximate, can vary slightly): 
     - Left cluster: x=280, y=340
     - Right cluster: x=360, y=340
     - Top highlight cluster: x=320, y=310
   - Radius: 30 to 35
   - Fill colors: use different green shades from the main foliage but slightly lighter or darker
   - Outline: transparent or dark green
   - Outline width: 0 or 1

4. Layer the smaller foliage clusters on top of the main ellipse to create depth.

5. Optional features:
   - Add a small patch of grass at the base using small green ellipses or lines near trunk base.
   - Add fruits or flowers as small circles of red, yellow, or orange scattered on foliage (optional).

Use layering: draw trunk first, then main foliage, then smaller clusters, and finally optional details.

Use slight variation in position and size of foliage clusters for natural appearance.
When drawing this object side by side with itself or something else make sure to add some distance.
